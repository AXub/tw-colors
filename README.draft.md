# Welcome to [tw-colors](https://github.com/L-Blondy/tw-colors)

The easiest & fastest way to add multiple color themes to Tailwind apps

## Why

**Problem:**
Using Tailwind's **dark mode** requires significant markup changes. Forget a "dark" variant and your app is broken... it's easy to make a mistake, therefore hard to maintain.

On the other hand [daisyui][daisyui-url] provides a simple and efficient method to add themes, but the name of the colors must follow a very precise scheme, impossible to add a "primary-emphasis" color because it is not one of the available color names.

Rather than... the goal is to...

Rather than applying variants everywhere or requiring an entire UI library just for theming, the goal is to make theming an existing app a one minute thing.

define once, use everywhere

I needed a library that:
1. could extend the theming capabilities of daisyui, allowing me to use my existing configuration and markup
2. did not ship a bunch of UI components, letting me use the UI framework of my choice without having to prefix everything.

## Highlights

* ðŸš€ **No markup change required**, no need to refactor your code!
* ðŸ“¦ **Zero impact** on the bundle size, it's just some tailwind stuff!
* âœ¨ **All color formats** are supported (HEX, rgb, hsl, color names...)
* ðŸ¤© **Nested themes** support
* ðŸ’« Full [Tailwind CSS Intellisense][tailwind-intellisense-url] support ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
